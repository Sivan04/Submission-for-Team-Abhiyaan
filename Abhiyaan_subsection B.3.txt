SUBSECTION B.3: Literature review and Theory

1) Different types of sensors are:
		1.Lidar
		2.Radar
		3.Sonar
		4.Camera
		5.Inertial Navigation systems
		6.GPS
1.Lidar:
	Lidar refers to light detection and ranging  
	It is a sensor which works based on the principle of projecting infrared rays and recieving it back.
	It calculates the particles/objects distance by calculating the time taken  
  ADVANTAGES:
	It senses the objects rapidly as the rays travel in speed of light
	It sends thousands of rays so it will give more accuracy to the vehicle 
  DISADVANTAGES:
	The infrared rays are harmful to humans and other creatures
	Few objects will reflect or refract infrared rays in this case it fails to identify the objects 
2.Radar:
	Radar refers to radio detection and ranging
	it works on the principle of emiting radio waves and recieving it back
	It calculates the particles/objects distance by calculating the time taken  
   ADVANTAGES:
	It senses objects fastly
	It sends thousands of waves so it will give more accuracy to the vehicle 
   DISADVANTAGES:
	Few objects will reflect or refract radio waves in this case it fails to identify the objects 
	These waves can also mix with the waves in air and get modulated
3.Sonar:
	Sonar refers to sound navigation and ranging
	It emits sound waves and recieve back and sense objects and also senses the one emitted by other objects
   ADVANTAGES:
	It can be used at any time(day/night)
	it senses objects fastly
   DISADVANTAGES:
	It recieves several kind of sounds and it detects few objects falsely
	The sound waves can harm animals
4.Cameras
	it works on the principle of Capturing Images With Cameras
	It works based on Computer vision
   ADVANTAGES:
	Objects are captured with high quality 
  DISADVANTAGES:
	it won't work well in all type of whether
5.Inertial Navigation system:
	it detects a carâ€™s physical movements
	These navigation devices help self-driving cars stabilize themselves
	
  ADVANTAGES:
	it also Help cars determine whether they should take any kind of protective safety actions 
  DISADVANTAGES:
	It can't be helpful if there is a problem in the avigation devices
6.GPS
	GPS refers to Global Positioning System
	Users with a GPS receiver can obtain geolocation and time information 
  ADVANTAGES:
	GPS data often varies around a five-meter radius so it gives more accuracy of the geolocation
  DISADVANTAGES:
	It is not used in many countries as many satelites are required to send and recieve information which is not available in a lot of countries

These sensors can be used in certain particular places like 
	Lidar,Sonar,Radar can be used mostly for object detections
	GPS can be used to obtain geolocation and time
	Inertial Navigation Systems can be used in cars and jeeps for saftey purpose

sensor fusion is the process of combining sensor data  derived from different sensors
	thus resulting information has less uncertainty than would be possible when these sources were used individually
	
the above mentioned sensors are used in combination so that we can get rid of errors
	it can be like Camera sensor ,inertial navigation system and GPS can combinely work to get more safety
